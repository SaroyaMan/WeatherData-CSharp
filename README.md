This project is a library that gives you a Weather data from REStful web services.

This library made to developers who wants to get easly the current Weather in different places around the world. This library made for C# developers. The big advantage that using that library is very easy, the code is an open source, so you can easly create your own WeatherData REStful web services just by creating a class that implements IWeatherDataService, and add the relevant constant to the static WeatherDataServiceFactory class (don't forget to extend the switch-case in GetWeatherDataService inside the factory class).

# How-to install
Download and extract the WeatherLibrary.zip from my git page.
On a project you are willing to use the library - right click on project and then Add -> Reference.
Browse the 2 DLL files from the extracted zip.
Add the directive 'Weather' (using Weather;) inside your source file.
That's it, you can now use the library!
